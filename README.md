##  A COMPLETE TUTORIAL FOR ACCOUNT ABSTRACTION ON CELO NETWORK:

### What is Celo?-
Some may not be familiar with Celo before, but there is no need to worry as this tutorial will act as a guide about Celo. It will help you understand, explore and take opportunities available on Celo platform.

So, letâ€™s get started:

 [Celo](https://docs.celo.org/developer) is a platform that empowers people by providing them with access to financial tools and services. 
You probably must have heard of Bitcoin or Ethereum and the likes of them, Celo is similar but not the same. 

[Celo](https://docs.celo.org/developer) is also an open-source blockchain platform that aims to create a more inclusive financial system by providing access to digital assets and decentralized applications (DApps) to anyone with a mobile.

Prior to now, blockchain users needed a quality network to access a financial services or carry out any form of transaction. [Celo](https://docs.celo.org/developer) blockchain focuses on mobile-first design just as we mentioned earlier, now it has become easy for users to access financial services through their mobile, with limited internet connectivity. Remember, it is said that there are 6 Billion smartphones on Earth!
Celo is taking them all into consideration.

What more is that decentralized applications (Dapps) can be built on its blockchain, as well as peer-to-peer lending, remittances, and micropayments.
 It uses a stablecoin called Celo Dollar (cUSD), which of course is pegged to the USD. The platform allows users to send and receive payments across different networks like cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.

 ### What is Account Abstraction?-
The ability to isolate the management of funds from the execution of smart contracts is referred to as account abstraction. It enables users to interact with smart contracts on the blockchain without having to hold the underlying cryptocurrency or token, to put it another way. This is accomplished using a method known as "meta transactions".

A meta transaction is a transaction that is started and signed by a user but carried out on their behalf by a third party. A relayer is a third party who acts on behalf of the user to pay the transaction fees in the underlying cryptocurrency (CELO). As a result, users can engage with smart contracts on the Celo network without owning any of the cryptocurrency.

As we said earlier that Decentralized app (Dapp) can be written on the Celo blockchain. In this system, the blockchain systems are held by smart contracts exclusively and not by externally-owned accounts (EOAs).

Traditionally, each user must pay a fee called gas fee to have their transaction processed by the network. The amount of gas required for a transaction varies, and it is determined by the complexity of the transaction and the current network congestion. This means gas fee can be very expensive, especially during times of high network usage. 
The stress of paying gas fee before a transaction is implemented is actually a pin in the neck, especially since it is not a fixed amount. 

This is where account abstraction comes in handy. **[Account abstraction](https://www.alchemy.com/account-abstraction)** enables smart contracts to pay transaction fees on behalf of their users (gas fees). This is done in the native currency of the blockchain. This means that users do not need to go through the trouble of paying gas fees themselves. This will make them focus on interacting with the DApp. The smart contract can use its own funds to pay the gas fees, which can be designed to be recovered from users in a variety of ways.

### How Does Account Abstraction Work on the Celo Blockchain?-

We are making some progress, aren't we?

The Celo blockchain focuses on mobile-first applications and it is designed to be highly accessible and user-friendly.  The Celo team implemented account abstraction as a core feature of the platform in order to understand how account abstraction works on Celo.

The Celo blockchain uses a Proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. It has Validators who are responsible for verifying transactions and adding them to the block on the blockchain. With this consensus mechanism, users can stake their tokens to participate in the validation of transactions. and they receive rewards for that. Energy consumption is more scalable as compared to blockchain networks. that use proof-of-work (PoW).S
We have already established that Celo also uses a stablecoin called the Celo Dollar (cUSD), which is pegged to the US dollar. Therefore, cUSD is the currency used to pay gas fees for transactions on the network. 

Account abstraction mechanism allows smart contracts to interact with multiple currencies and assets without being tied to any specific logic. This is achieved by abstracting away the native currency of the network, and allowing smart contracts to interact with virtual balances that represent any currency or asset that is supported on the network. This makes it easier to build more complex and flexible decentralized applications, that can help to reduce the complexity of smart contract code.

Account abstraction on Celo allows smart contracts to be designated as "paying accounts." These contracts are given a special type of account that can hold both cUSD and [CELO](https://docs.celo.org/developer) tokens.  When a user interacts with a DApp that uses account abstraction, the smart contract can use its own funds to pay the gas fees for the transaction. The contract can then charge the user for the gas fees in cUSD or other tokens. How does that sound?
Smart contracts are written in a specific programming language, such as Solidity, and are designed to interact with the native currency. This means that if a smart contract wants to interact with another currency or asset, it needs to include specific logic to do so. 

```solidity 
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0

pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;

// Interface for the ERC20 token
interface IERC20 {
    function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256);
    function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
}

contract AccountAbstraction {
    // Address of the Celo token Gold contract
    address private constant cGLDAddress = 0x471EcE3750Da237f93B8E339c536989b8978a438;
    // Address of the Celo Dollars token contract
    address private constant cUSDAddress = 0x765DE816845861e75A25fCA122bb6898B8B1282a;
    
    // Returns the balance of the user's cGLD and cUSD tokens
    function getBalances(address user) public view returns (uint256, uint256) {
        uint256 cGLDBalance = IERC20(cGLDAddress).balanceOf(user); // Get cGLD balance
        uint256 cUSDBalance = IERC20(cUSDAddress).balanceOf(user); // Get cUSD balance
        return (cGLDBalance, cUSDBalance);
    }
    
    // Sends cUSD tokens to the recipient
    function sendCUSD(address recipient, uint256 amount) public {
        require(IERC20(cUSDAddress).transfer(recipient, amount), "Transfer failed."); // Transfer cUSD
    }
    
    // Sends cGLD tokens to the recipient
    function sendCGLD(address recipient, uint256 amount) public {
        require(IERC20(cGLDAddress).transfer(recipient, amount), "Transfer failed."); // Transfer cGLD
    }
}

```
The above contract defines two functions to send cUSD and cGLD tokens, respectively. It also includes a `getBalances` function that returns the user's balances of these tokens.

### Benefits of Account Abstraction:

- Increased Efficiency: Abstraction enables the division of concerns among several network levels. The network's efficiency and scalability are increased as a result of this separation.

- Flexibility: The Celo network can be used as the foundation for a variety of unique solutions and services thanks to abstraction. Because of this adaptability, developers can design programs that cater to certain user demands.

- Enhanced Security: By isolating various network components, abstraction can aid in enhancing the security of the Celo network. This separation lowers the possibility of attacks and guarantees the network's stability and security.

- Easier Maintenance: Abstraction makes it easier to maintain the Celo network by reducing the complexity of the system. This makes it easier for developers to fix issues and add new features to the network.

- Interoperability: Abstraction can enable interoperability with other blockchain networks, allowing the Celo network to communicate and exchange information with other networks. This can enhance the overall functionality and usefulness of the network.

### Downsides of Account Abstraction:

Just like any other networks, Celo network also has some drawbacks which are as follows-

- Increased gas costs: Account abstraction might result in increased gas costs for transactions on the Celo network since it necessitates additional computation.

- Account abstraction creates new security risks, such as the chance that the abstraction layer contains errors or that hostile actors could use system flaws to their advantage.

- Issues with interoperability: Account abstraction may make it more challenging to guarantee interoperability between various platforms for smart contracts, which may restrict the use cases and adoption of the Celo network.

### Conclusion-

Even though account abstraction has some challenges, the benefits are enormous. Therefore it is crucial to carefully examine and manage any risks and drawbacks that could come with this feature, and take the full advantages embedded in it.
