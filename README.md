## What Is Celo All About?
Some may not be familiar with Celo before now, but not to worry, that is the basis for this tutorial. It will help you understand, explore and take opportunities available on the Celo platform.
Letâ€™s get started:

Celo is taking them all into consideration.

What is more is that decentralized applications (Dapps) can be built on its blockchain, as well as peer-to-peer lending, remittances, and micropayments.

It uses a stablecoin called Celo Dollar (cUSD), which of course is pegged to the US dollar. The platform allows users to send and receive payments across different networks using cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.

## What Is Account Abstraction?
The ability to isolate the management of funds from the execution of smart contracts is referred to as account abstraction. It enables users to interact with smart contracts on the blockchain without having to hold the underlying cryptocurrency or token, to put it another way. This is accomplished using a method known as meta transactions.

A [meta transaction](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/learn/sending-gasless-transactions) is simply a transaction that is started and signed by a user but carried out on their behalf by a third party. A [relayer](https://hackernoon.com/what-is-a-transaction-relayer-and-how-does-it-work-bd1q3ywa) is a third party who acts on behalf of the user to pay the transaction fees in the underlying cryptocurrency (CELO). As a result, users can engage with smart contracts on the Celo network without owning any of the cryptocurrency.

Remember we said earlier that decentralized apps (Dapp) can be written on the Celo blockchain. In this system, the blockchain systems are held by smart contracts exclusively, not by [externally-owned accounts (EOAs)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/).

Traditionally, each user must pay a fee called the gas fee to have their transaction processed by the network. The amount of gas required for a transaction varies, and it is determined by the complexity of the transaction and the current network congestion. This means gas fees can be very expensive, especially during times of high network usage. 
The stress of paying gas fees before a transaction is implemented is a pin in the neck, especially since it is not a fixed amount. 



## How Does Account Abstraction Work on the Celo Blockchain?

We are making progress, isn't it?

The Celo team implemented account abstraction as a core feature of the platform.

The Celo blockchain uses a [proof-of-stake (PoS)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/) consensus mechanism. It has validators who are responsible for verifying transactions and adding them to the block on the blockchain. With this consensus mechanism, users can stake their tokens to participate in the validation of transactions. and they receive rewards for that. Energy consumption is more scalable as compared to blockchain networks that use [proof-of-work (PoW)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pow/). 
We have already established that Celo also uses a stablecoin called the Celo Dollar (cUSD), which is pegged to the US dollar. Therefore, cUSD is the currency used to pay gas fees for transactions on the network. 

The account abstraction mechanism allows smart contracts to interact with multiple currencies and assets without being tied to any specific logic. This is achieved by abstracting away the native currency of the network and allowing smart contracts to interact with virtual balances that represent any currency or asset that is supported on the network. This makes it easier to build more complex and flexible decentralized applications that can help to reduce the complexity of smart contract code.

Account abstraction on Celo allows smart contracts to be designated as "paying accounts." These contracts are given a special type of account that can hold both cUSD and [CELO](https://docs.celo.org/developer) tokens.  When a user interacts with a dApp that uses account abstraction, the smart contract can use its funds to pay the gas fees for the transaction. The contract can then charge the user for the gas fees in cUSD or other tokens. How does that sound?

Smart contracts are written in a specific programming language, such as Solidity, and are designed to interact with the native currency. This means that if a smart contract wants to interact with another currency or asset, it needs to include specific logic to do so.

Here's an example of a Solidity smart contract that can be used to transfer and read the balances of CELO and cUSD.

```solidity 
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0

pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;

// Interface for the ERC20 token
interface IERC20 {
    function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256);
    function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
}

contract AccountAbstraction{
    // Address of the CELO token contract
    address private constant celoAddress = 0xF194afDf50B03e69Bd7D057c1Aa9e10c9954E4C9;
    // Address of the Celo Dollars token contract
    address private constant cUSDAddress = 0x874069Fa1Eb16D44d622F2e0Ca25eeA172369bC1;
    
    // Returns the balance of the user's CELO and cUSD tokens
    function getBalances(address user) public view returns (uint256, uint256) {
        uint256 cGLDBalance = IERC20(celoAddress).balanceOf(user);
        uint256 cUSDBalance = IERC20(cUSDAddress).balanceOf(user);
        return (cGLDBalance, cUSDBalance);
    }
    
    // Sends cUSD tokens to the recipient
    function sendCUSD(address recipient, uint256 amount) public {
        require(IERC20(cUSDAddress).transfer(recipient, amount), "Transfer failed.");
    }
    
    // Sends CELO tokens to the recipient
    function sendCELO(address recipient, uint256 amount) public {
        require(IERC20(celoAddress).transfer(recipient, amount), "Transfer failed.");
    }
}
```
The above contract defines two functions to send cUSD and cGLD tokens, respectively. It also includes a `getBalances()` function that returns the user's balances of these tokens.

## Benefits of Account Abstraction
- Increased Efficiency: Abstraction enables the division of concerns among several network levels. The network's efficiency and scalability are increased as a result of this separation.

- Flexibility: The Celo network can be used as the foundation for a variety of unique solutions and services thanks to abstraction. Because of this adaptability, developers can design programs that cater to certain user demands.

- Enhanced Security: By isolating various network components, abstraction can aid in enhancing the security of the Celo network. This separation lowers the possibility of attacks and guarantees the network's stability and security.

- Easier Maintenance: Abstraction makes it easier to maintain the Celo network by reducing the complexity of the system. This makes it easier for developers to fix issues and add new features to the network.

- Interoperability: Abstraction can enable interoperability with other blockchain networks, allowing the Celo network to communicate and exchange information with other networks. This can enhance the overall functionality and usefulness of the network.

## Downsides of Account Abstraction
Just as it is with other networks, the Celo network is not without some challenges.

Below are some of them:

- Increased gas costs: Account abstraction might result in increased gas costs for transactions on the Celo network since it necessitates additional computation.

- Account abstraction creates new security risks, such as the chance that the abstraction layer contains errors or that hostile actors could use system flaws to their advantage.

- Issues with interoperability: Account abstraction may make it more challenging to guarantee interoperability between various platforms for smart contracts, which may restrict the use cases and adoption of the Celo network.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, even though account abstraction has some challenges, the benefits are enormous. Therefore it is crucial to carefully examine and manage any risks and drawbacks that could come with this feature, and take the full advantages embedded in it.
