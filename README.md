## Introduction

**[Celo](https://docs.celo.org/developer)** is an open-source blockchain ecosystem that uses blockchain technology to enable decentralized finance and social impact projects. One of the core concepts of Celo is account abstraction, which allows developers to write smart contracts that can interact with different types of accounts, such as wallets and contracts, without needing to know the details of the underlying account.

Account abstraction is a powerful feature in the world of blockchain technology that allows developers to create more user-friendly and secure smart contract interactions. The Celo network is one of the few blockchain platforms that support account abstraction, making it an ideal choice for developers who want to build decentralized applications that can leverage this feature.

In this tutorial, I will provide a step-by-step guide to building an account abstraction contract on the Celo network using Solidity, and then deploying and interacting with it using the Celo SDK and JavaScript.

## Prerequisites

Before you can start building an account abstraction contract on the Celo network, you need to have the following:

1. Basic understanding of Solidity and smart contracts. 
2. Basic understanding of the Celo network and its architecture
3. Install Node.js and npm: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. npm is a package manager for Node.js. You can download Node.js and npm from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/.
4. A Celo wallet with some CELO tokens for paying gas fees

## Understanding Account Abstraction

Let's first discuss what account abstraction is and how it operates before getting started with its implementation on Celo.

Each transaction in a conventional blockchain network is processed separately and costs a fixed amount of gas to complete. The amount of computational labor necessary to complete a network transaction is measured in gas. The amount of gas used increases with transaction complexity.

Account abstraction is a feature that allows for multiple transactions to be executed in a single transaction. It works by abstracting the accounts and transactions involved in a smart contract interaction, allowing for more flexibility and efficiency.

There are two types of account abstraction:

1. Transaction-level account abstraction: This allows for multiple transactions to be executed in a single transaction. It is useful for optimizing gas usage and reducing transaction fees.

2. Contract-level account abstraction: This allows for a smart contract to be abstracted, allowing for multiple transactions to be executed within the context of the contract. This is useful for complex smart contract interactions and for optimizing gas usage.

Account abstraction is a very important feature on the Celo blockchain, as it provides several benefits for smart contract developers and users. Some of the key benefits of account abstraction include:

1. Flexibility: With account abstraction, smart contracts can interact with any type of account on the Celo blockchain, including EOAs, contract accounts, and meta transactions. This makes it easier to write smart contracts that are flexible and compatible with different types of accounts.

2. Efficiency: By using a common interface for interacting with different types of accounts, account abstraction can help to reduce the complexity and overhead of smart contract development on Celo.

2. User Experience: Account abstraction can also improve the user experience of decentralized applications on Celo by enabling users to interact with dApps without having to worry about gas costs. This can help to make dApps more accessible and user-friendly.

3. Security: Account abstraction can help to improve the security of smart contracts on Celo by reducing the risk of errors and vulnerabilities that can arise from working with different types of accounts.

## Creating an Account Abstraction Contract

To implement account abstraction on Celo, you will create a smart contract that utilizes the account abstraction allows users to execute transactions using their accounts. 

First, you need to define the interface of your contract. This will include the functions and variables that your contract will use like this:

```solidity
interface IAbstraction {
    function executeTransaction(
        address payable to,
        uint256 value,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external returns (bool success, bytes memory returnData);
}
```

This interface defines a single function called `executeTransaction`. This function takes three parameters:

. `to`: the address of the account or contract that will receive the transaction
`value`: the amount of wei to send with the transaction
`data`: the data to send with the transaction

The function returns two values:

`success`: a boolean value indicating whether the transaction was successful or not
`returnData`: the data returned by the transaction.

Next, you need to implement the contract using the interface you defined above:

```solidity
contract Abstraction is IAbstraction {
    function executeTransaction(
        address payable to,
        uint256 value,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external override returns (bool success, bytes memory returnData) {
        (success, returnData) = to.call{value: value}(data);
    }
}
```

This implementation defines a contract called `Abstraction` that implements the `IAbstraction` interface. The `executeTransaction` function simply calls the `call` function on the `to` address with the specified `value` and `data`. The `call` function is a low-level function that allows you to send a transaction to another account or contract on the Celo network

Note that you used the `external` modifier to specify that this function can only be called from outside the contract. You also used the `override` modifier to indicate that you are overriding the function defined in the `IAbstraction` interface.

In order to guard against malicious activity and illegal access, it's crucial to include security checks in our contract. This is how to do it:

```solidity
contract Abstraction is IAbstraction {
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function executeTransaction(
        address payable to,
        uint256 value,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external override returns (bool success, bytes memory returnData) {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the contract owner can execute transactions");
        require(to != address(0), "Invalid destination address");

        (success, returnData) = to.call{value: value}(data);
        require(success, "Transaction failed");
    }

    function changeOwner(address newOwner) external {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the contract owner can change the owner");
        require(newOwner != address(0), "Invalid new owner address");

        owner = newOwner;
    }
}
```

In this implementation, you added an `owner` variable to track the owner of the contract. You also added a constructor to set the owner to the address that deploys the contract.

In the `executeTransaction` function, you added two security checks. First, you checked that the sender of the transaction is the owner of the contract. This prevents unauthorized access to the function. Second, you checked that the `to` address is not the null address (`0x0`). This ensures that the transaction has a valid destination.

After executing the transaction, you added a third security check to ensure that the transaction was successful. If it wasn't, you revert the transaction.

Finally, you added a `changeOwner` function that allows the current owner to change the owner of the contract. You added security checks to ensure that only the current owner can call this function and that the new owner address is valid.

## Deploying the Contract

Now that you have created your account abstraction contract, you need to deploy it to the Celo network. To do this, you need to follow these steps:

- Compile the contract
Use the Solidity compiler to compile the contract code. You can do this using the following command:

```bash
solc Abstraction.sol --bin --abi --optimize -o build/
```

This command will compile the Abstraction.sol contract and generate the binary code, ABI (Application Binary Interface), and optimized code in the build/ directory.

Now that we have written and compiled the account abstraction contract, we can deploy it on the Celo network using the Celo SDK and JavaScript.

- Open a new terminal window and navigate to your project directory. Install the Celo SDK by running the following command:

```bash
npm install @celo/contractkit
```

Next, you will import the necessary modules and set up the connection to the Celo network by adding the following code to a new JavaScript file:

```javascript
const Web3 = require('web3');
const ContractKit = require('@celo/contractkit');

const web3 = new Web3('https://forno.celo.org');
const kit = ContractKit.newKit('https://forno.celo.org');
````
In this code, you are importing the necessary modules for Web3 and the Celo SDK, and then creating instances of Web3 and ContractKit to connect to the Celo network.

```javascript
async function deployAbstractionContract() {
    const accounts = await kit.web3.eth.getAccounts();
    const Abstraction = new kit.web3.eth.Contract(AbstractionContract.abi);

    const tx = Abstraction.deploy({
        data: AbstractionContract.bytecode
    });

    const txObject = {
        from: accounts[0],
        gasPrice: '1000000000',
        gas: '5000000',
        value: '0'
    };

    const txPromise = tx.send(txObject);

    const receipt = await txPromise;
    console.log(receipt);
}
```

In this code, you are creating a new function called `deployAbstractionContract` that will deploy the account abstraction contract on the Celo network. WYou will first get an array of available accounts using the Celo SDK, and then create a new instance of the contract using the ABI and bytecode generated by Solidity compiler.

Next, you will create a new transaction object with the necessary gas and gas price settings, and then send the transaction using the `send` function. Finally, you will wait for the transaction to be mined and print out the receipt.

Run the `deployAbstractionContract` function by adding the following code:

```javascript
deployAbstractionContract()
    .then(() => {
        console.log('Contract deployed successfully!');
        process.exit(0);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error('Error deploying contract:', error);
        process.exit(1);
    });
```

In this code, you are running the `deployAbstractionContract` function and then printing out a success message if the contract was deployed successfully, or an error message if it failed.

Well-done for coming this far, you are almost there...

Now it's time for you you to deploy your contract with the command below;

```bash
node deploy.js
```

If everything worked correctly, you should see a success message in the terminal indicating that the account abstraction contract was deployed successfully.

## Interacting with the Contract

Now that you have deployed the account abstraction contract, you can interact with it using JavaScript and the Celo SDK. In this section, you will create a new JavaScript function that will execute a transaction using the account abstraction contract.

- Create a new JavaScript function to execute a transaction using the account abstraction contract by adding the following code:

```javascript
async function executeTransaction(recipient, value, data) {
  const accounts = await kit.web3.eth.getAccounts();
  const contract = new kit.web3.eth.Contract(abi, contractAddress);
  const txObject = {
    from: accounts[0],
    to: contractAddress,
    gas: 1000000,
    gasPrice: await kit.web3.eth.getGasPrice(),
    data: contract.methods.executeTransaction(recipient, value, data).encodeABI()
  };
  const tx = await kit.sendTransactionObject(txObject);
  const receipt = await tx.waitReceipt();
  console.log(`Transaction receipt:\n${JSON.stringify(receipt, null, 2)}`);
  return receipt;
}
```

The `executeTransaction` function is an asynchronous function that takes three parameters: `recipient`, `value`, and `data`. These parameters are used to send a transaction to the `AccountAbstraction` contract on the Celo network.

Inside the function, you will first get the user's Celo account using `kit.web3.eth.getAccounts()`. You will then create a new instance of the `Contract` class from `@celo/contractkit` using the contract ABI and address.

Next, you created a `txObject` with the `from` address, `to` address, gas limit, gas price, and encoded transaction data using the `contract.methods.executeTransaction` method. You will then use `kit.sendTransactionObject` to send the transaction and `tx.waitReceipt()` to wait for the transaction to be confirmed.

Finally, you loged the transaction receipt to the console and returned it.

To use this function, you need to import the `contractkit` module and initialize it with a provider;
```bash
new ContractKit('https://forno.celo.org')
```
You also need to provide the contract ABI and address as arguments to the function.

Here is an example of how to use the `executeTransaction` function:

```javascript
const { ContractKit } = require('@celo/contractkit');

const kit = ContractKit.newKit('https://forno.celo.org');
const abi = [/* AccountAbstraction contract ABI */];
const contractAddress = '<contract-address>';

async function main() {
  const recipient = '<recipient-address>';
  const value = '1000000000000000000'; // 1 CELO
  const data = '0x'; // empty data

  const receipt = await executeTransaction(recipient, value, data);

  console.log(`Transaction receipt:\n${JSON.stringify(receipt, null, 2)}`);
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

This code imports `ContractKit` from `@celo/contractkit`, initializes it with the Forno endpoint, and defines the `abi` and `contractAddress` variables. It then defines an async `main` function that calls the `executeTransaction` function with the `recipient`, `value`, and `data` parameters, and logs the transaction receipt to the console.

To run this code, save it to a file and name it interact.js.

Then run this command below in your terminal:

```bash
node interact.js
```
